"""Hidden-line extraction shared by the Blender exporters (Blender only).

Used by century/exporter.py (Century, p(bloom), the quality scenes),
hardware3d/family_core.py (the hardware family and its studies) and
hardware3d/radial.py (quantum simulator). The drawing style is unchanged: the
same camera basis and projection, the same roles, and the same features are
lines:

* boundary edges of open surfaces;
* creases (adjacent face normals below ``CREASE_DOT``) with a front face;
* the outline of smooth surfaces: every smooth edge between a front-facing and
  a back-facing face (the exact outline of the faceted surface, so every view
  keeps its frame);
* wire centrelines.

What changed against the first exporters (in Git history):

Visibility. The old test accepted any point whose first ray hit belonged to the
same object, so every hidden edge of a concave part was drawn (the inner end
face of a split collar, the far rims inside rings and hoods), accepted hits up
to 0.35 units in front of other objects (edges just under a skin leaked), and
sampled every 1.1 units with 8 bisections, so clipped ends stopped short or
poked past. Now a point is visible when no face lies in front of it by more
than ``DEPTH_TOL``; only the faces around its own edge (sharing a vertex) and
grazing hits on its own surface within one face size are ignored. Samples are
spaced at a fixed fraction of the drawn extent (under half a pixel on the 5K
master) and every change of visibility is bisected to 1e-7 of that, so a line
ends exactly where something passes in front of it.

Topology. Vertices of one mesh are welded, so the closing seam of a lathed
ring, hood or loft is no longer a pair of boundary edges drawn across the part.
Windings are made consistent and closed parts face outward (an airfoil rib
with inward caps counted its visible side as back-facing). The rim of a flat
n-gon cap is one loop, drawn whole or not at all. Drawn edges are chained into
polylines through vertices where exactly two meet.
